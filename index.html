      <span class="first-letter"></span> We start our Thamel Heritage walk from Tri Devi Marg. To find this easily located The Garden of Dreams, The Real North Face Stores and across the road Fire & Ice Pizza. This is Tri Devi Marg! If facing Fire & Ice Pizza turn left and walk down the road a little, just to your right you will find some metal gates leading to the Tri Devi temples. 

 On this page is the full Thamel heritage walk which can easily join up with other heritage walks you can do for free by yourself.

      There are many restaurants in Thamel that serve traditional and continental cuisine, although prices are significantly higher than in non-tourist areas. Thamel also acts as the pre-base camp for mountaineers.

      Start your heritage walk early! Traffic and congestion in Kathmandu is a problem. Early in the morning the markets are opening and there's less traffic so you'll get the most out of your walk. Better yet, go on a Saturday morning which is when it's quietest.

     Continue walking along this road passing through several guesthouses and local buildings until you get to the main busy road known as Thamel Marg. Take a right here and walk to the end until you get to a very busy intersection on the northern border of Thamel. Take a left here and walk on the pavement until you get to a fenced in area housing some shrines to your left.

     Bring water with you. There are plenty of shops selling bottled water along the way, but they can get crowded. Brining your own water saves time.

      Thamel is known by its narrow alleys crowded with various shops and vendors. Commonly sold goods include food, fresh vegetables/fruits, pastries, trekking gear, walking gear, music, DVDs, handicrafts, souvenirs, woolen items and clothes. Travel agencies, small grocery stores, budget hotels, restaurants, pubs and clubs also line the streets. Cars, cycle rickshaws, two-wheelers and taxis ply these narrow streets alongside hundreds of pedestrians. Recently many roads in Thamel have been declared vehicle free zones to avoid crowd and traffic havoc
